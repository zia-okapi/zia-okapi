Welcome to the our github repository.

Zia-Okapi is an API for the ZIA : An epitech project.

# Don't panic!

We still lack some features such as handling SSL / TLS.

We're still under development so these features will come very very soon, they are already designed but the way we will implement them is not completly fixed. Stay tuned!
